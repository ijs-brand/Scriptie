All files of the thesis are combined in this folder.
There are several files in this folder:
1. The thesis
2. The simulation
3. The code
4. The data

1. The thesis
The thesis is in the large folder and is called "Scriptie_6212573".

2. The simulation
The simulation can be found at Assets -> Scenes -> SampleScenes. This opens (if
Unity is installed) the environment in which the simulation is done.

3. The code
The code can also be found under the map "Assets". This can be opened in the usual 
manner.

4. The dates
The data of the simulation can be found in the large folder "ScriptieDefinitief". This 
makes it possible to open the data in R and re-analyze it. The data can be found in the
folder "Data Interpretation".

Good luck!
